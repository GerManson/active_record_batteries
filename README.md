# ActiveRecordBatteries

ActiveRecordBatteries is a simple library that aims to provide some basic, useful tools for your models without a lot of complexity.

## Modules

- *Paginable*, provides database pagination.
- *Sluggable*, provides slug support for your models, normally used for pretty urls.
- *Deletable*, provides logical deletes.
- *Filterable*, provides an easy way to filter your results.
- *RelationshipScopes*, provides a way to add scopes for your relationships in a single line.

## Getting started

ActiveRecordBatteries works with Rails 4+. You can add it to your Gemfile with:

```ruby
gem active_record_batteries'
```

Run the bundle command to install it.


## Usage

To load the batteries on your models:

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  batteries! :sluggable, :paginable, :filterable, :relationship_scopes, :deletable
end
```

You can use any or all of them at the same time.

## Final remarks

We wrote this code as we built [Chopeo](https://www.chopeo.mx) because we found most solutions to these problems to be more complicated than they needed to be for our case.

Most people build things in a way that should work for every case which is a great goal. For this library, our goal was to keep it as simple as possible. It should cover most situations.
